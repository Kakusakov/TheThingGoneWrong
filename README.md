# TheThingGoneWrong
A tactical stealth game about a shapeshifter.

You are a shapeshifting monster that snuck inside a military base.

The twist is that you are completely harmless, in spite of the fact that everyone 
is convinced that you are able to "infect" and "replace" people.

The goal is to exploit this irrational fear and make soldiers turn on one another, 
eventually eliminating each other.
