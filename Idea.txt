--- PERMISE ---
You are a shapeshifting monster that snuck inside a military base.

The twist is that you are completely harmless, in spite of the fact that everyone 
is convinced that you are able to "infect" and "replace" people.

The goal is to exploit this irrational fear and make soldiers turn on one another, 
eventually eliminating each other.

--- CORE ---
* Top-down 2d view.
* Encourages strategic thinking: 
*   * Enemies are impossible / inefficient / undesirable to fight directly
      (player dies fast, enemies deal a lot of damage and have ways to identifying player).
*   * Player always knows what AI will do (AI is perdictable and communicates 
      it's intentions).
* Stimulates playing on:
*   * Plan-B mechanics to continue after making a mistake:
*   *   * Dash away when spotted.
*   *   * ...
*   * Prevent cases when player runs out of options to win:
*   *   * Pervent running out of ways to kill enemies.
*   *   * Pervent being cornered with no ways to escape.
*   *   * ...
* Makes humour:
*   * References:
*   *   * References to "The Thing" (obviously).
*   *   * References to H. P. Lovecraft's works.
*   *   * References to "Among Us"???
*   *   * ...
*   * Twists common horror tropes:
*   *   * Flamethrowers are ineffective.
*   *   * ...

--- MECHANICS ---
* GamePlay:
*   * The goal is killing all enemies on the level.
*   * Killing enemies:
*   *   * Two most common ways of killing enemies is either causing an infighting
          or killing them through context actions.
*   *   * Causing infighting is the main mechanic of the game and other mechanics
          MUST NOT compete with it.
*   *   * Infighting:
*   *   *   * TODO! This requires a broad spectrum of ways to cause an infighting.
*   *   * Context Actions:
*   *   *   * ...
*   *   * Special cases when friendly-fire is allowed:
*   *   *   * Explosives.
*   *   *   * Certain kinds of enemies have friendly fire ON by default.
*   *   *   * Random mistakes, that can be made by enemies.
*   *   *   * ...
* Enemies:
*   * A rather primitive AI satate-machine that focuses on routine behaviour 
      until disturbed.
*   * Several unique kinds of enemies, which showcase / enhance certain mechanics.
*   * Fight:
*   *   * Enemies deal quite a lot of damage, but also die pretty fast.
*   *   * Friendly fire is disabled unless speicifically desired by an enemy.
*   *   * Some actions have a small chance to be failed, which may result in 
          various penalties for the enemies.
*   * Stress system:
*   *   * Enemies have a level of stress, that grows whenever they see shocking,
          scary, unexpected stuff.
*   *   * High stress level makes tricking enemy harder, but also makes 
          manipulating them easier.
*   *   * Behaviour changes when stress is high:
*   *   *   * Stressed enemies are more cautious.
*   *   *   * Stressed enemies are more aggressive.
*   *   *   * Stressed enemies are more likely to make a mistake.
*   *   *   * Stressed enemies may abandom their routines.
*   *   *   * ...
*   * Familiarity system:
*   *   * Enemies have a field of view, and whenever something enters it, they
          take some time to build familiarity with it.
*   *   * Familiarity system only works on things enemy considers normal and
          usual (mostly / only people).
*   *   * Stages of familiarity:
*   *   *   * Recognition:
*   *   *   *   * Takes a relatively small amount of time (0.5 - 1 second).
*   *   *   *   * The enemy identifies the thing that entered his field of view 
                  and can immediately take action if this thing is something
                  special / dangerous / etc.
*   *   *   * Familiarity:
*   *   *   *   * If enemy sees certain object / person for a significant time
                  (may require a bit of time depending on the pacing) and 
                  does not recognize this object as anything special, he 
                  builds a familiarity with it.
*   *   *   *   * Enemies tend to trust the people they are familiar with a
                  lot more.
*   *   *   *   * Enemies tend to trust the people they are familiar with more.
*   *   *   *   * ...
* Movement:
*   * The player has a below average movement speed, but can use certain tricks 
      to gain a rather significant, but temporary / limited speed advantage.
*   * Dash:
*   *   * The player has an ability to dash with a reasonably short cooldown.
*   *   * The dash is only avaliable in monster (native) form.
*   *   * Dash use cases:
*   *   *   * Quicker movement.
*   *   *   * Escaping enemies when spotted.
*   *   *   * Quickly engaigng with a certain target.
*   *   *   * Breaking certain objects.
*   *   *   * ...
*   * Ventilation:
*   *   * The player can get inside the airing system to quickly travel
          between air vents (SUS!).
* Shapeshifting:
*   * The player is a shapeshifting monster, which can change it's appearance.
*   * Shapeshifting allows player to avoid being noticed and allows a whole
      range of special actions, so it must have a set of penalties, that
      would encourage player to use it wisely.
*   * Shapeshifting has quite a significant cooldown.
*   * Transforming into enemies:
*   *   * Player can transform into enemies, which allows him to infiltrate
          into enemies' ranks and gives him new ways of causing infighting.
*   *   * ...
